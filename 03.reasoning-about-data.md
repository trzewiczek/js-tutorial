# Reasoning About Data
After basic data modeling we're ready to move our focus toward the means of reasoning about the data. We will learn how to make our data meaningful in the business context we operate in by applying strict business criteria to the data model. Things like _What makes our customer a major one?_, _What criteria should a link comply with to meet accessibility standards?_, _After how many seconds should the unanswered call be transferred to a voice mail?_.

To go through the topic let's use a simple example mentioned in the previous paragraph: _What makes our customer a major one?_. For the purpose of this chapter let's assume it means it falls upon one of these categories:

 * makes at least 500 payments on our platform with the total sum of payments exceeding $100000;
 * the sum of payments exceeds $250000 though the number of transactions is less than 500.

This covers both loyal every day customers as well as occasional big buyers.

To follow with this example will have to design a data model and fill it with some test data. Let's make it as simple as:

```javascript
const customers = [
  {
    name: 'Audi',
    numberOfTransaction: 281,
    total: 231000
  },
  {
    name: 'BMW',
    numberOfTransaction: 573,
    total: 96000
  },
  {
    name: 'Citroën',
    numberOfTransaction: 176,
    total: 379000
  },
  {
    name: 'Toyota',
    numberOfTransaction: 732,
    total: 224000
  }
]
```

After a quick look at the data we see that only Citroën and Toyota can be considered as major customers. No personal preferences bias in the test data, I promise.

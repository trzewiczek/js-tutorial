# Reasoning About Data
After basic data modeling we're ready to move our focus toward the means of reasoning about the data. We will learn how to make our data meaningful in the business context we operate in by applying strict business criteria to the data model. Things like _What makes our customer a major one?_, _What criteria should a link comply with to meet accessibility standards?_, _After how many seconds should the unanswered call be transferred to a voice mail?_.

To go through the topic let's use a simple example mentioned in the previous paragraph: _What makes our customer a major one?_. For the purpose of this chapter let's assume it means a customer falls upon one of these categories:

 * makes at least 500 payments on our platform with the total sum of payments exceeding $100,000;
 * the sum of payments exceeds $250,000 even though the number of transactions is less than 500.

This covers both loyal every day customers and occasional big buyers.

To follow with this example we will design a data model and fill it with some test data. Let's make it as simple as:

```javascript
const customers = [
  {
    name: 'Audi',
    numberOfTransaction: 281,
    total: 231000
  },
  {
    name: 'BMW',
    numberOfTransaction: 573,
    total: 96000
  },
  {
    name: 'Citroën',
    numberOfTransaction: 176,
    total: 379000
  },
  {
    name: 'Toyota',
    numberOfTransaction: 732,
    total: 224000
  }
]
```

After a quick look at the data we see that only Citroën and Toyota can be considered major customers. No personal bias in the test data, I promise.

## Comparisons
To check if a customer is a major one, we have to have some means of comparison—is number of transactions greater than 500, is total money spent greater than $100k, etc. 

JavaScript provides us with a reasonable collection of comparison tools:

```javascript
a === b      // a equals b
a !== b      // a doesn't equal b
a > b        // a is greater than b
a >= b       // a is greater than or equals b
a < b        // a is less than b
a <= b       // a is less than or equals b
```

> double slash (`//`), until the end of the line. This way we can leave

> of comparison provided by JavaScript. Smart!

Using these operators we can now make some assertions about our customers:

```javascript
// Acceptance Criteria:
// · at least 500 payments and more than $100k in total
// or
// · more than $250k in total

// First customer: Audi
const audi = customers[0]

// test first part of the first acceptance criterion
audi.numberOfTransactions >= 500   // false

// first criterion failed so check the second criterion
audi.total > 250000                // false

// Well, Audi is no major customer...


// Another customer: Toyota
const toyota = customers[3]

// test first part of the first acceptance criterion
toyota.numberOfTransactions >= 500   // true

// first part passed so check the other part of the first criterion
toyota.total > 100000                // true

// We can consider Toyota our major customer!
```

This way we can continue with each of the customers and one by one compare respective values with our acceptance criteria. The obvious problem is that these acceptance criteria are somehow related and make sense only when considered together.

## Compositions
To accomplish that JavaScript offers us a set of operators for composing multiple comparisons into a single test. These are:

```javascript
a && b  // read: a AND b, i.e. logical conjunction
a || b  // read: a OR b, i.e. logical alternative
!a      // read: NOT a, i.e. logical negation
```

For each of these operators `a` and `b` is a boolean value—`true` or `false`. (Your friend is true, it's an oversimplification and we will explain it in the last section of this chapter. Be patient!). Let's review each operator one by one. 

### Conjunction
The first acceptance criterion on our list consists of two comparisons: _at least 500 payments_ **AND** _more than $100k in total_. This means that **both** comparisons have to turn `true` for the whole criterion to be satisfied. In other words, if any of those comparisons will turn `false` acceptance criterion won't be fulfilled. 

Let's put it into code:

```javascript
   const audi = customers[0]
   audi.numberOfTransactions >= 500 && audi.total > 100000
// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//             false                AND        false
//             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                                false

   const bmw = customers[1]
   bmw.numberOfTransactions >= 500 && bmw.total > 100000
// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//             true                AND        false
//             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                                false
```

> I've added three extra spaces at the beginning of code lines just to make reading the visual comments below easier. Don't do it at home!

In the code snippet above we see that neither Audi nor BMW passes the combined test. Audi fails on both comparisons and BMW fails on the total payments one even though it passed the minimal number of transactions test. 

To make conjunction easier to remember let's present its working in a special table:

|     a     |     b     |  result  |
|:---------:|:---------:|:--------:|
| **true**  | **true**  | **true** |
| **true**  | _false_   | _false_  |
| _false_   | **true**  | _false_  |
| _false_   | _false_   | _false_  |

and state the intristic truth of it: **conjunction is true only when all its parts are true**.

### Alternative
Even though Audi and BMW failed hard on the first acceptance criterion, we can still give them another try with the other one: _more than $250k in total_. What we want to express here then is that a customer has to comply with one **OR** the other criterion and if it does with at least one of them, we'll still consider it major. 

Let's put it into code:

```javascript
   const audi = customers[0]
// { name: 'Audi', numberOfTransaction: 281, total: 231000 }

   (audi.numberOfTransactions >= 500 && audi.total > 100000) || audi.total > 250000
// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   
//             false                AND        true          OR        false
//             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                    ^^^^^
//                                false                      OR        false
//                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                                                          false

   const bmw = customers[1]
// { name: 'BMW', numberOfTransaction: 573, total: 96000 }   

   (bmw.numberOfTransactions >= 500 && bmw.total > 100000) || bmw.total > 250000
// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//             true                AND        false        OR        false
//             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                  ^^^^^
//                                false                    OR        false
//                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                                                        false
```

> We put additional paranthesis just to make sure how JavaScript will read our logical expression. If we think of it, putting the paranthesis around our alternative would give us completely different meaning of the expresson: `bmw.numberOfTransactions >= 500 && (bmw.total > 100000 || bmw.total > 250000)`. Weird, isn't it? Let's skip it and go back to the main narrative. 

We've already known both customers fail on the first criterion and gave them another chance. Unfortunately they fail on the other one as well, so in the end we won't consider them major customers. Before moving foreward let's see how it works for Citroën and Toyota:

```javascript
   const citroen = customers[2]   
// { name: 'Citroën', numberOfTransaction: 176, total: 379000 }

   (citroen.numberOfTransactions >= 500 && citroen.total > 100000) || citroen.total > 250000
// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  
//                  false               AND          true          OR         true
//                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                     ^^^^
//                                     false                       OR         true
//                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                                                                true

   const toyota = customers[3]
// { name: 'Toyota', numberOfTransaction: 732, total: 224000 }

   (toyota.numberOfTransactions >= 500 && toyota.total > 100000) || toyota.total > 250000
// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                 true                AND          true         OR        false
//                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                   ^^^^^
//                                    true                       OR        false
//                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                                                              true
```
For Citroën and Toyota—as we see above—either one or the other criterion turns `true` so we may consider them major customers. 

To make alternative easier to remember let's present its working in a special table:

|     a     |     b     |  result  |
|:---------:|:---------:|:--------:|
| **true**  | **true**  | **true** |
| **true**  | _false_   | **true** |
| _false_   | **true**  | **true** |
| _false_   | _false_   | _false_  |

and state the intristic truth of it: **alternative is false only when all its parts are false**.

# JavaScript from Scratch

## The metaphor
One of the common programming metaphors is a recipe one. Programming is like making a dinner -- a sequence of strict steps leading to a delicious result. Even though it's hard to deny this metaphor there is yet another one that turns out to be useful in software architecture design -- the metaphor of an assembly line. Programming is made of little data transformation shops, each being unaware of the others but being highly skilled in doing one thing, i.e. transforming certain type of objects into another specific ones. Painting shop in car assembly line doesn't necessarily know it's a car and why it's to be painted red, but knows how to take this weird silver metal shape from previous shop, how to paint it red and finally how to safely pass it to the next shop, whatever it is. What's more if only the manufacture manager is smart enough the painting shop won't only paint red, but you'll be able to select a colour depending on the market demand.

In this tutorial we will try to keep as close to this metaphor as possible. We will focus on these parts of JavaScript and programming in general that help us focus on data processing and great code modularity.

## Data Processing
For the programming to be data processing activity we need three basic ingredients (pun intended): data modeling toolkit, means of data transformation and finally way to reason about the data.

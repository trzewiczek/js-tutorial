# JavaScript from Scratch

## Disclaimer
Before we start I'd like to make a kind of disclaimer about the tutorial. Parts of the disclaimer may sound alien at first. That's fine. Focus on JavaScript now and come back to it whenever you feel you want to check what is a teaching approach I took in this tutorial. And this tutorial **is** opinionated.

First of all it focuses only on a subset of JavaScript, the one that will get you up to speed quickly. It won't go into language design details and all the advanced features. It will cover parts most used in the regular day to day programming activities of an average JavaScript developer like myself.

With this in mind tutorial teaches ES6 and beyond, i.e. the modern version of JavaScript. It won't cover legacy concepts and won't make any excuses when using popular [stage-3 JavaScript features](https://github.com/tc39/proposals). This decision is enforced by using [Standard](https://standardjs.com/), a JavaScript linter that helps us keep our code style consistent and following community guidelines.

Last but not least this tutorial is rooted in more functional than object-oriented mindset. It won't go into complex in-depth concepts of functional programming though. It will utilize 'the functional way' to keep code clean, composable and easy to reason about without making too big a deal about fancy names, complex concepts or math theory.
